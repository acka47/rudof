# Current changes without release yet

# [0.0.10] - 2024-01-29

- [issue 32](https://github.com/weso/shapes-rs/issues/32) ShEx parser works as an iterator per statement allowing to show debug information by statement. Debug information can be controlled by the environment variablt RUST_LOG. A value of "debug" for that variable will print more information.

# [0.0.9] - 2024-01-19

- Removed `shex_pest`, `shex_antlr` and `validation_oxgraph` folders because their code is no longer used.
- Added time option to `sx_cli`
- Repaired bug in `shex_compact` that failed with node constraints followed by cardinality without space
- More support to read SHACL as RDF
- Merged [srdf_graph](https://crates.io/crates/srdf_graph) and [srdf_sparql](https://crates.io/crates/srdf_sparql) crates into [srdf](https://crates.io/crates/srdf), the former crates will no longer be maintained as their code is integrated in `srdf`.
- Added option `--output` to CLI so the users can choose if the output goes to terminal or to a file
- Changed dependency from [rio_api](https://crates.io/crates/rio) and [rio_turtle](https://crates.io/crates/rio_turtle) to [oxttl](https://crates.io/crates/oxttl) and [oxrdfio](https://crates.io/crates/oxrdfio) which seem to be more actively maintained now.

# [0.0.7] - 2024-01-07

In this release we added support for SHACL by defining the [`shacl_ast`](https://crates.io/crates/shacl_ast) crate. 

Other changes: 
- Renamed the project from shex_rs to shapes_rs to indicate that the project intends to support both ShEx and SHACL.
- Merged the [srdf_graph](https://crates.io/crates/srdf_graph) and [srdf_sparql](https://crates.io/crates/srdf_sparql) crates into [srdf](https://crates.io/crates/srdf). 
-  Added more combinators and documentation examples to rdf_parser in order to document the RDF parser combinators approach. See, for example, the doc for the [map method](https://docs.rs/srdf/latest/srdf/srdf_parser/trait.RDFNodeParse.html#method.map).
